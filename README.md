### Algorithms
Playground for Algorithms

This is a kickstarter for different interesting algorithms written in Java !! It was fun to explore and write. Hope you enjoy and contribute too.

Algorithms:
1) Count the number of occurences of a particular token within a string. eg: Find number of occurences of "HELLO" in "HERTLYUOHRLELLO". Test - 2 occurences

2) Get the Binary gap - Get the count of the maximum sequence of 0s in a given Integer eg: Result for 32 is 5

3)Cyclic Rotation : Given an array , rotate it by given number of steps


4)Odd Occurences in Array - Given an Array determine the odd occurence
	A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.

5)PermMissingElem - Find missing element in given permuation
