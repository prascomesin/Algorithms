### Algorithms
Playground for Algorithms

This is a kickstarter for different interesting algorithms written in Java !! It was fun to explore and write. Hope you enjoy and contribute too.

Algorithms:
1) Count the number of occurences of a particular token within a string. eg: Find number of occurences of "HELLO" in "HERTLYUOHRLELLO". Test - 2 occurences
2) Get the Binary gap - Get the count of the maximum sequence of 0s in a given Integer eg: Result for 32 is 5
